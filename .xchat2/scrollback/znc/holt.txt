T 1375195933 6<danielp6>	that sounds like a cool thing to do, I should get around to settling on a key
T 1375195961 2<holt2>	This is either a PGP or Gnu-PG key, not an ssh key.

T 1375196043 2<holt2>	I ended up creating one long time ago for encrypting my data files.  When the kernel implemented their requirement on the web-of-trust for getting gitolite access to git.kernel.org, I generated a new one.
T 1375196092 2<holt2>	I think that new one expires fairly soon.
T 1375196114 2<holt2>	Oh, wait, it expires at the end of November.  I better fix that up RFN.

T 1375201752 6<danielp6>	ahhh...that was never clear to me
T 1375201813 2<holt2>	Actually, it looks like pgp.org is completely expired now.  It looks like it is all in GnuPG as a reference implementation of PGP.
