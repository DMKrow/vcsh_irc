T 1339523644 2<20dfults2>	Ok, that test finally failed
T 1339523675 2<20dfults2>	and now we have a bunch of cart.c zombies
T 1339523741 2<20dfults2>	I'm going to kill off this test run, since we've got a failure and potentially unkillable procs
T 1339523764 6<danielp6>	ok
T 1339523976 6<danielp6>	anything to make of those bt's?
T 1339524018 2<20dfults2>	Not really.. Those can come about if there's and earlier problem and then xpmem can't clean up properly
T 1339524091 2<20dfults2>	I can dissect the xpmem structs with crash and maybe get more insight
T 1339526173 2<20dfults2>	Tests are off and running again.  I ran mpich112/cart.c again and it didn't fail this time
T 1339526358 6<danielp6>	what about this zombie process phenomenon?
T 1339526412 2<20dfults2>	Not sure at this point.  
T 1339526443 2<20dfults2>	The crash dump hung
T 1339526532 2<20dfults2>	We were seeing this same thing in stout706.. but other bugs were fixed and then we didn't see it anymore
T 1339526613 2<20dfults2>	I should try mpisanity a few times in a row just to verify we're not seeing Karl's problem on uv182
T 1339527249 2<20dfults2>	Not sure why we aren't seeing any shared_high dropins when that variable is on.  huge dropins are low too
T 1339527582 2<20dfults2>	now our huge dropins are up to what I'd expect
T 1339532677 2<20dfults2>	What was this error again?
