T 1381410981 2<22erikj2>	pjd - advice - in the testing I was doing yesterday I found a corner case....  dmraid systems with gpt labels will produce error messages from grub but will still work ok. But if a dmraid system with a dmraid were on the admin, it would probably not function because, at least at the moment, we're still doing true chain loading on the admin to get to the slots.
T 1381411004 2<22erikj2>	pjd We could leave it alone (I know of no dmraid case on admin nodes) or I could try to make the admin chainload thing be based on grub2
T 1381411016 2<22erikj2>	I propose we just leave it alone for now and tackle it later if we even need to
T 1381411068 2<24pjd2>	I agree, it is a very small corner case. If we somehow have a field system run into this, we will guide them around it.
T 1381411099 2<22erikj2>	I don't think we sell admin nodes like that. The only sold dmraid systems I'm aware of were the optic mummy stuff as service nodes
T 1381413187 2<22erikj2>	pjd I've been thinking and I think we'd regret not making the admin MBR have grub2 to match the network boot stuff.
